# 3.0 Is Here!

This syntax package for Sass and SCSS has been [largely rewritten](https://github.com/braver/SublimeSass/pull/86). This brings it more in line with the default CSS package. If you're seeing differences in highlighting, that's probably why. If you see any problems, please report them and we'll sort them out ASAP!

3.0.0 should be slowly rolling out to everyone and is limited to the very latest versions of Sublime Text. If you want the latest build right now, participate in the beta releases by editing your Package Control preferences and adding Sass to the "install_prereleases" key:
 ```json
 "install_prereleases":
 [
   "Sass"
 ]
 ```

# SCSS and Sass syntax for Sublime Text 3

Includes completions for CSS properties and values, as well as relevant Sass functions.

Highlights code using up to date specifications for properties and values to help you catch typos.

Syntax highlighting should be very similar to [CSS](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/tree/master/CSS).


## Installation

This package is available through [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

## Key Bindings

Previous versions of this package came with key bindings. Improved completions and ST's default behaviour should make this unnecessary. Bring them back by [adding them to your key binding settings](https://github.com/braver/SublimeSass/blob/2.4.1/Default.sublime-keymap).
