# SCSS and Sass syntax for Sublime Text 3

Includes completions for CSS properties and values, as well as relevant Sass functions.

Highlights code using up to date specifications for properties and values to help you catch typos.

Syntax highlighting should be very similar to [CSS](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/tree/master/CSS). We're on a different release schedule from the default CSS package, so sometimes we're a bit ahead, sometimes we're behind.

Notes: The Sass syntax is currently frozen as it has various [open issues](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/216) and limitations compared to the SCSS syntax, and the Sass team itself doesn't seem overly concerned with supporting it.


## Installation

This package is available through [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

## Key Bindings

Previous versions of this package came with key bindings. Improved completions and ST's default behaviour should make this unnecessary. Bring them back by [adding them to your key binding settings](https://github.com/braver/SublimeSass/blob/2.4.1/Default.sublime-keymap).
